## I found

50 old photos I&rsquo;d deemed lost (and almost cry over it).

What I was looking for.

Yet another website I own (and host) and had completely forgotten about.

A new way to make time go by faster.

## I wrote

&hellip;some things in an interview with the lovely people of JSConf Australia (including fun facts about the best jobs I&rsquo;ve ever had!)

&ldquo;If all else is broken, at least we still got Bey.&rdquo;

&ldquo;lolnope.&rdquo; (seriously, though)

&ldquo;See you in November.&rdquo;

&ldquo;At this point, I&rsquo;m very happy I&rsquo;m still able to speak English.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one to recklessly hate music.&rdquo;

## I was

A song that a Bar Pianist chose to play for me

&ldquo;I love this move of always just showing up.&rdquo;


## I thought

About how, in the end, everything always comes down to this one song by The National

About Venn Diagrams

And music
